Hexagoner
By Marc Davenport and Brandon Mccaig for TINS2021

Code Reuse
I'm reusing some code for a simple little hex game I made that was never finished. It is up on github with Eagle and has been ever since I wrote it.

License

Libraries used :
Eagle 0pt8pt2
Allegro 5.2.7.1GIT

Rule fulfillment :

MC Escher like - I'm going to make a logo with interleaved hexagons and try to tile it.

Plug - We're going to include a plug for my Eagle library

Hexagon - the game is hex based

Unit tests - bambams is going to write unit tests to test my mersenne twister prng from c++11

Funny/humorous - going to skip this rule if we can, since we will have unit tests
